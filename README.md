# About The Repository
> ## CURRICULUM
  - This complete repository explains all concepts of Data Structure and Algorithm from basic to advanced.
  - Different Sections have been listed as different **Branches**.
  - For every section I have created a .ipynb file.
  
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/1.Introduction">1.INTRODUCTION</a>
  - In this section basic content has been explained.
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/2.Recursion">2.RECURSION</a>
  - The process in which function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.
  - I have tried to give a good idea about recursion in this section.
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/3.Recursion_Questions">3.RECURSION QUESTIONS</a>
  - I have tried some important questions in this section.
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/4.BigO_Notation">4.BigO NOTATION</a>
  - Big O Notation is a way of describing the performance or efficiency of the code.
  - I have tried to discuss the idea of Big O in this section
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/5.BigO_Questions">5.BigO QUESTIONS</a>
  - I have tried some important question based on Time Complexity in this section.
  
  <a href="https://github.com/priyanshty19/Python-DSA/tree/6.Arrays">6.ARRAYS</a>
  - I have tried to explain One dimensional and multi dimensional arrays
  - Also tried few basic practice questions to get a better understanding of arrays
